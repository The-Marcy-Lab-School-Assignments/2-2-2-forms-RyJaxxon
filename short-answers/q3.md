# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

The first two have the same default behavior, as 'buttons' default behavior is simply to submit.

`reset` makes the button reset our forms, resetting any form fields to their initial states.

`button` makes it so our button has no default action, just a fun clicky button. This can be used for customization purposes.
