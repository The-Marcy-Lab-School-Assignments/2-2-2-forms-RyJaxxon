# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

Labels make forms easier to understand and use while also increasing accessibility as their click areas often correspond with input's you may have making things more intuitive. We can label in two ways, using the 'for' attribute, or directly wrapping our desired element in a label tag.
